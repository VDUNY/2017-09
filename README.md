## Software Security Basics Presentation

Writing software in a secure manner is not as easy as it might seem at first look. It is not enough to simply say "I use encryption, I'm good". How you implement and manage encryption and other security related mechanisms can mean the difference between closing and locking a 2ft thick 10-ton steel door and leaving the keys in the lock. In this presentation I will attempt to define some common security mechanisms and common sense ways to use them to better protect your organization and it's data.

## Demos
	Demo 1: Basic hashing (with standard output)
	Demo 2: Salted hash & storage
	Demo 3: Verifying a salted hash
	Demo 4: Hashed Message Authentication Codes (HMAC)
	Demo 5: Password Based Key Derivation Functions (PBKDFv2)
	Demo 6: Symmetric encryption using AES
	Demo 7: Asymmetric encryption using RSA (in memory)
